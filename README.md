# Exp 1 Mode Characteristics of Fiber Optic Cable

## 🎯 AIM
```
To study the mode characteristics of fiber optic cable and observe the lower order Linearly Polarized (LP) modes.
```
## 🧰 EQUIPMENTS REQUIRED
```
1. LASER Source (633 nm – 1mW)  
2. Source to Fiber Coupler  
3. Single Mode Fiber  
4. Fiber Holding Stand  
5. Opaque Screen  
```
## 📚 THEORY
```
The central spot carries 95% of the intensity for laser beams with Gaussian profile. I = Ioe-2(r / w) ^2 where e = 2.718 is the base of the natural logarithm. An accepted definition of a radius of a Gaussian beam is t 0.135 times its peak value Io. This radius is called spot size. The spot diameter is w.
Spot Diameter (d) micron = Focal length of the Lens (f) mm x Laser beam full divergence angle (DA) mrad.
In order to achieve maximum coupling efficiency, the fiber core diameter has to be bigger than the spot diameter.
NA rays = Laser Beam Diameter (B.D.) 2 x Lens Focal Length (f)
The source coupler is comprised of two base plates. One of the base plates contains a focusing lens
and a female connector receptacle. The other base plate is attached onto the laser. An O-ring is sandwiched between the base plates. Threaded screws interconnect the two base plates. A screw driver
to alter the angular orientation of one base plate relative to the	other can then adjust the screws.
 
The number of modes propagating through the fiber depends on V-number. If the fiber whose number is less than 2.045,	it allows to propagate single mode through it, so it is called as Single Mode fiber.
A Multimode fiber, V-number is slightly greater than 2.045 but the number of allowed modes is small enough that they may be individually identified when the output of the fiber is examined.
When V < 2.045, then only a single mode may propagate in the fiber waveguide. This mode is HE11 mode or LP01 – Linearly Polarized mode.
When V > 2.045, other modes may propagate, when V is slightly greater than 2.045 i.e. V = 4.91 then 4 Linearly Polarized modes will propagate through fiber.

## 🧪 PROCEDURE
```
1. Place the optical breadboard on a flat surface.
2. Mount the He-Ne laser source securely onto the breadboard.
3. Attach the laser to the fiber coupler mount, aligned with the laser exit.
4. Turn on the laser and align the beam spot centrally using the mount's travel adjustments.
5. Check for back reflection from the rod lens and adjust screws to redirect it into the laser exit.
6. Confirm central alignment using a white card; adjust if off-center.
7. Connect the multimode fiber patch cord to the coupler and secure the other end in the fiber holder.
8. Adjust the fiber tip height to ~50 mm above the white sheet.
9. Observe the multimode speckle pattern on the screen. Adjust screws to refine the pattern.
10. Replace with single mode fiber patch cord. Observe blur patterns of LP modes (e.g., single lobe, two lobes, etc.) by fine-tuning the coupler screws.

## 📊 OBSERVATION AND CALCULATION
```
Parameter of given fiber are,
A = 4.5μm (core radius), N.A = 0.11, λ = 633nm V = 2 π x A x N.A / λ = 4.91
From fig. shows only 4 LP modes propagates.
Total number of modes = V2 / 2 = 4.912 / 2

## Result
```
The study successfully achieved the aim by observing the lower-order Linearly Polarized (LP) modes of the fiber. The Single Mode Fiber output was examined, showing the fundamental LP01 mode (a single circular spot) and higher-order LP modes (patterns with two, three, and four lobes) when the coupling alignment was slightly adjusted.
